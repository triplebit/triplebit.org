## Anonymous Hosting Services

Triplebit hosts some public services which can be accessed anonymously (without an account). This website (`triplebit.org`) uses both Umami Statistics and Object Storage services to collect data and serve content, but these services are also used by other websites as described below.

### Umami Statistics

Triplebit collects some anonymous information about users visiting and interacting with various websites, including this website and the websites of our customers. We only collect data about customer websites if they choose to utilize our hosted Umami Statistics service. If you encounter a website not operated by Triplebit which interacts with the `stats.triplebit.net` data collection service, you should refer to that website's privacy policy to see what information they collect and why.

We collect data such as the name of your browser and the pages you visit. We use a service called Umami in conjunction with a private server-side logging service that strictly collects and stores non-personal information which cannot be used to identify you.

The data collected is never tied to a particular user, and is used solely for statistical reasons.

We limit the processing of personal data to what is strictly necessary to provide the service.

### Object Storage

Triplebit stores data in a Garage S3 object storage cluster on its own behalf and on behalf of our customers. This data is commonly used to: host static websites, act as a content delivery network, store static media assets, etc.

Access to the data hosted by Triplebit depends on the data bucket's access policies. Commonly, public data will be accessible without any form of authentication.

Triplebit does not ask for or collect any personal information while operating this service. However, data hosted by Triplebit may include personal or sensitive information that has been uploaded to our services or a service operated by one of our customers. You should refer to the privacy policy of the application that integrates with our object storage service for more information about what data is stored and why. Triplebit has no knowledge of any individual data uploaded to our service.

We limit the processing of personal data to what is strictly necessary to provide the service.

## Account-Based Services

### CryptPad

Our CryptPad instance at [docs.triplebit.net](https://docs.triplebit.net) uses 100% open source software, client and server. Anyone can inspect its source-code and host the service in a personal or professional capacity.

CryptPad uses persistent storage in users' browsers, such as localStorage, indexedDB, and related storage methods that may be legally classified as cookies. These are applied to maintain a continuous session across browser tabs and successive visits to the site, to decrease loading times, and to remember per-device preferences like the use of dark mode.

We limit the processing of personal data to what is strictly necessary to provide the service.

### Email

Our email services may collect information from you when you email an account hosted on our service. This information includes your mail server's IP address, your email address, your name, and any message content.

If you have a mailbox hosted with our email service, we may collect your name, password, mailbox content, the IP addresses of mail servers you email and receive emails from, the names and email addresses of your contacts and those which send you email, any incoming or outgoing emails and their contents, and any other data you upload to your account.

We limit the processing of personal data to what is strictly necessary to provide the service.

## Information We Share

Triplebit never furnishes information we collect about you to third parties.

Triplebit only shares information about you that was given to us by third parties (i.e. our customers) with those same third parties for the purposes of providing our services to them. We never share this information with others without the written consent of our customers.

## Our Customers' Services

Triplebit hosts a variety of web services for other customers. We process your data on their behalf according solely to their written instructions, and do not use your data for any other purpose.

Upon the request of our customers, we can provide a Data Processing Agreement.

## Subprocessors

Triplebit is a hosting and internet service provider, and all equipment we use is 100% owned and controlled by us. Triplebit never outsources the processing of your data to third parties.

Triplebit does rent colocation space for this equipment in commercial data centers around the world. The operators of these data centers have no access to information stored on our servers, which is enforced through physical security measures and strong encryption.

The data center operators and other upstream transit internet service providers we use may be able to collect some metadata about your network connections to our services, such as your IP address. This is the nature of all unencrypted internet traffic, and is not exclusive to Triplebit or any agreements we may have with these data centers.
