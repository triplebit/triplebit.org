# Tor Relays

Triplebit operates high performance, unfiltered, and high capacity exit relays on the Tor network. We are compliant with [CIISS 2](https://nusenu.github.io/ContactInfo-Information-Sharing-Specification/) and [Tor Proposal 326](https://spec.torproject.org/proposals/326-tor-relay-well-known-uri-rfc8615.html).

Triplebit's goal is to enable IPv6 connectivity and promote IPv6 adoption across the Tor network and the internet as a whole. As such, our relays and infrastructure are 100% dual-stack.

If you are concerned about traffic originating from our network, please consult our [FAQ](legal.md) before contacting us, although we are always happy to discuss!

Triplebit currently operates the following relays (by fingerprint):

However, it may be more useful for you to browse [this interactive list](https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html#search/as:AS401332) of our relays for more information.
