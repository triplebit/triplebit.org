# Tor Relays

If you are concerned about traffic originating from our network, please consult our [FAQ](legal.md) before contacting us, although we are always happy to discuss!

Triplebit currently operates the following relays (by fingerprint):

```
--8<--
docs/.well-known/tor-relay/rsa-fingerprint.txt
--8<--
```

However, it may be more useful for you to browse [this interactive list](https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html#search/as:AS401332) of our relays for more information.

Triplebit's goal is to enable IPv6 connectivity and promote IPv6 adoption across the Tor network and the internet as a whole. As such, our relays and infrastructure are 100% dual-stack.
